## Overview
This project is a clone of the popular note-taking app Evernote. While not a direct clone, the functionality is similar in that users are able to take notes, share notes with other users, and (in a future implementation) add notes to notebooks.
## Getting started
Clone this repository
Install dependencies
Create a .env based on .env.example
